# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Exploration (Excel & SQL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores global COVID-19 data using SQL and Excel to uncover trends in infections, deaths and vaccinations.  
The dataset was cleaned, transformed and analyzed to generate meaningful insights for understanding the pandemic impact.

---

## 🧩 Business Problem
There is a lack of structured insights to understand:
- Infection spread across countries  
- Death rates and severity  
- Vaccination progress globally  

This makes it difficult to analyze trends and support data-driven decisions.

---

## 🎯 Goal
Analyze COVID-19 data using SQL to identify patterns in cases, deaths and vaccinations for better global insights.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description

### 🗂 CovidDeaths
- location  
- date  
- total_cases  
- new_cases  
- total_deaths  
- population  
- continent
- etc...

### 🗂 CovidVaccinations
- location  
- date  
- new_vaccinations  
- continent
- etc...

## 🧹 Data Preparation
- Cleaned and formatted Excel datasets  
- Ensured consistency for SQL joins  
- Converted data types for calculations  
- Handled NULL and division errors using `NULLIF()`  

---

## 🛠 SQL Techniques Used
- Aggregate Functions (SUM, MAX)  
- JOINS  
- Window Functions (`SUM() OVER PARTITION BY`)  
- CTE (Common Table Expressions)  
- Temp Tables  
- CREATE VIEW  
- Data Type Conversion  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Infection and death rates vary significantly across countries  
- Some countries show high infection but lower death rates  
- Vaccination rollout differs widely across regions  
- Rolling vaccination trends show steady progress over time  
- Population size impacts overall COVID impact analysis

## 💼 Business Impact
- Helps understand global pandemic trends  
- Supports public health analysis  
- Enables country-wise comparison  
- Provides foundation for BI tools like Power BI/Tableau  

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel  
- SQL Server (SSMS)  
- SQL
