-- Link to Dataset - https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
-- From above downloaded dataset, We make two datasets named as 'CovidDeaths' and 'CovidVaccinations' to explore them.

-- Skills used : SQL FUNCTIONS, JOINS, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, CREATE VIEWS, Converting Data Types

-- Result : Recent DeathPercentage Rate in Afghanistanis is 3.4%
